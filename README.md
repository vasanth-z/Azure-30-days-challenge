### 2. Enable Static Website Hosting

1. Go to your storage account in the Azure Portal.

2. Under **Data management**, select **Static website**.

3. Click **Enabled** to activate static website hosting.

4. Provide the **Index document name** (e.g., `index.html`).

5. (Optional) Specify the **Error document path** (e.g., `404.html`).

6. Click **Save**. Azure will generate a primary endpoint URL for your website.

   - **Note**: Copy this URL; it will be used to access your website.

---

### 3. Upload Your Website Files to the Storage Account

1. Go to the **Containers** section of your storage account.

2. Select the `$web` container (created automatically when static website hosting is enabled).

3. Click on **Upload** to upload your website files (e.g., `index.html`, `styles.css`, images, etc.).

   - **Public Access**: Ensure the files are accessible to the public.

4. After uploading, you can access the website using the endpoint URL you saved earlier.

---

### 4. Enable Versioning on the Storage Account

1. In your storage account, go to **Data protection** under **Data management**.

2. Locate **Blob versioning** and click **Enable**.

3. Click **Save**.

   - **Note**: Versioning ensures that any updates to files in the `$web` container create a new version, allowing for version management.

---

### 5. Update the Website and Manage Versions

1. When you update any file in the `$web` container (e.g., modify `index.html`), a new version is created automatically.

2. **To Roll Back to a Previous Version**:
   - Go to the **$web** container.
   - Right-click on the file you want to revert.
   - Select **Manage versions** to view all available versions.
   - Choose the desired version and either **Restore** it or download it for editing.

3. Once restored, the endpoint URL will reflect the chosen version.

Your static website is now hosted on Azure Blob Storage with version control, allowing for efficient management and rollbacks.
