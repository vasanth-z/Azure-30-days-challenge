# Azure Cost Management and Budget Alerts: Step-by-Step Guide

This Proof of Concept (POC) will help you understand **Azure's cost management tools** and how to monitor and control your spending.

---

## Step 1: Access Azure Cost Management
1. **Log in to the Azure Portal**: [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Search for **"Cost Management + Billing"** in the search bar at the top.

---

## Step 2: Create a Budget
1. **Navigate to Budgets**:
   - In the "Cost Management" section, click on **"Budgets"**.
2. **Create a New Budget**:
   - Click on the **"Add"** button.
   - Choose your **subscription** for which you want to create the budget.
   - Provide a **name** for the budget (e.g., *"Monthly Budget"*).
   - Set a **time period** (monthly is recommended for better tracking).
   - Define your **budget amount** (e.g., â‚¹1,000 or $10, depending on your currency).
3. **Set Budget Alerts**:
   - Add alert rules (e.g., notify when usage exceeds 50% and 75% of the budget).
   - Configure your email address to receive notifications.
4. **Review and Save**:
   - Review your settings and click **"Create"**.

## Step 3: Analyze Costs
1. **Navigate to Cost Analysis**:
   - Under "Cost Management," click on **"Cost Analysis"**.
2. **View Spending**:
   - Select a **time range** (e.g., current month).
   - Analyze costs by services (e.g., Virtual Machines, Storage).
3. **Filter and Group Data**:
   - Use filters to view costs for specific services.
   - Group data by **Resource Group** or **Service** to get detailed insights.

---

## Step 4: Configure Spending Alerts
1. **Set Up Spending Alerts**:
   - In "Cost Management," click on **"Alerts"**.
   - Add a new alert rule to trigger notifications based on specific spending thresholds.
   - Link these alerts to your Azure Action Group (optional).
2. **Test Alerts**:
   - Simulate reaching the threshold by provisioning low-cost resources (e.g., a small Virtual Machine).
   - Check if the alert is triggered and email notifications are sent.

---

## Step 5: Optimize Costs
1. **Review Cost Recommendations**:
   - In "Cost Management," check for **recommendations** to optimize resources (e.g., resize underutilized VMs).
2. **Enable Autoscaling** (Optional):
   - For services like VMs or App Services, configure **autoscaling** to reduce costs during low usage periods.

---

## Learning Outcomes
- You will understand how to monitor and analyze costs in Azure.
- You'll know how to set up budgets and receive alerts for spending control.
- You'll explore ways to optimize costs based on recommendations.
