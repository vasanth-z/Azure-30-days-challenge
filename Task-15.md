# Setting Up and Using Azure Databricks

## 1. Set up an Azure Databricks Workspace

  Go to the Azure Databricks service and click **Create**. Provide necessary details such as:
  - Subscription

  - Workspace name
  - Region
- **Access Workspace**:  
  Once deployed, navigate to the workspace and click **Launch Workspace** to access the Databricks environment.

## 2. Create a Cluster
- **Navigate to Clusters**:  
  In your Databricks workspace, go to the **Clusters** section.
- **Create Cluster**:  
  Click on **Create Cluster** and configure it by selecting:
  - Cluster type

  Select the language (e.g., Python, Scala, SQL, R) you want to use.
- **Attach to Cluster**:  
  Link the notebook to the cluster you created by selecting the cluster from the top-right corner.
- **Start Coding**:  
  Write your code in the notebook and run the cells to execute the logic.

## 4. Upload and Manage Data
- **Upload Data**:  
  In Databricks, you can upload data files by going to the **Data** tab and selecting **Add Data**. Choose your data source (e.g., CSV, Parquet, JSON) and upload it.
- **Access Data**:  
  Once uploaded, access the data via notebooks using Spark or other available libraries to process the data.

## 5. Run and Automate Jobs
- **Create a Job**:  
  Go to the **Jobs** tab, click **Create Job**, and select the notebook you want to run.
- **Configure Job**:  
  Set up job parameters like:
  - Schedule
  - Cluster size
  - Retry policies
  - Other configurations
