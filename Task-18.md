# Setting Up Azure Sentinel for Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)

Azure Sentinel is a scalable, cloud-native SIEM and SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) solution that helps collect, detect, investigate, and respond to security threats.

## Step 1: Log In to Azure Portal
1. Go to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Sign in with your Azure account.

---

## Step 2: Create a Log Analytics Workspace
Azure Sentinel requires a Log Analytics Workspace to store and analyze logs.  
1. In the search bar, type **Log Analytics Workspaces** and select it.  
2. Click **+ Create**.  
3. Fill in the required details:
   - **Subscription**: Select your subscription.
   - **Resource Group**: Choose an existing group or create a new one.
   - **Name**: Provide a unique name for the workspace.
   - **Region**: Select the region closest to you.  
4. Click **Review + Create** and then **Create**.

## Step 3: Enable Azure Sentinel
1. After the Log Analytics Workspace is created, navigate to **Azure Sentinel** by typing it in the search bar.
2. Click **+ Add**.
3. Select the **Log Analytics Workspace** you created earlier.
4. Click **Add Azure Sentinel**.

## Step 4: Connect Data Sources
To start collecting data, you need to connect your data sources.  
1. In Azure Sentinel, go to the **Configuration > Data Connectors** tab.
2. Choose from a variety of data sources such as:
   - **Azure Services**: Azure AD, Azure Activity, Key Vault.
   - **Microsoft Solutions**: Microsoft 365 Defender, Defender for Endpoint.
   - **Third-Party Solutions**: Palo Alto, Symantec, and more.
3. For each connector:
   - Click **Open Connector Page**.
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to connect and configure.

---

## Step 5: Configure Analytics Rules
1. Go to the **Analytics** tab.
2. Click **+ Create > Rule** to set up detection rules.
3. Choose a template or create a custom rule:
   - Define the query logic (e.g., searching for anomalous activity in logs).
   - Set thresholds and conditions for alert generation.
4. Save the rule.

---

## Step 6: Set Up Workbooks
1. Navigate to the **Workbooks** tab to visualize data insights.
2. Choose pre-built workbooks or create a custom one.
3. Use the workbook to monitor security metrics and threat trends.

---

## Step 7: Automate Responses with Playbooks
1. Go to the **Automation** tab and click **+ Add Playbook**.
2. Use **Logic Apps** to create automated workflows for specific incidents, such as:
   - Sending alerts to email or Teams.
   - Isolating compromised resources.
3. Save and test the playbook.

---

## Step 8: Monitor Incidents
1. Navigate to the **Incidents** tab to view generated alerts.
2. Investigate incidents by analyzing associated logs and related activities.
3. Use the investigation graph to trace the threat's root cause.

---

## Step 9: Fine-Tune Sentinel
1. Regularly review and optimize:
   - Analytics rules for better threat detection.
   - Data retention settings to manage costs.
2. Add additional connectors as needed to cover new security needs.

---

## Step 10: Secure Your Environment
1. Enable **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** to limit access to Azure Sentinel.
2. Set up audit logs and logging for compliance.
