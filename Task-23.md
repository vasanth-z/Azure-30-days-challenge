## üìÇ Step 4: Deploy Your Application

### Option 1: Using Azure Portal Deployment Center
1. Go to the **App Services** blade and select your newly created web app.
2. In the left-hand menu, click on **Deployment Center**.
3. Choose a deployment method:
   - **GitHub**: Connect your GitHub repository for CI/CD.
   - **Local Git**: Use Azure's local Git for deployment.
   - **ZIP Deployment**: Upload a `.zip` file containing your application code.
4. Follow the prompts to complete the deployment.

### Option 2: Using Azure CLI
1. Install the [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) and sign in:
   ```bash
   az login
   ```

## üîó Step 5: Access the Web App
1. Navigate to the **App Services** blade in the Azure Portal.
2. Select your web app from the list of deployed apps.
3. In the **Overview** section, locate the **URL** of your web app (e.g., `https://<your-app-name>.azurewebsites.net`).
4. Open the URL in your browser to verify and view your deployed application.

## üîç Step 6: Monitor Your Web App
1. Navigate to your web app in the Azure Portal.
2. In the left-hand menu, click on **Metrics** to monitor key performance indicators, such as:
   - **CPU Usage**: Helps track the processing power used.
   - **Memory Usage**: Displays the amount of memory consumed by your app.
   - **Requests**: Tracks the total number of incoming requests.
   - **Response Times**: Measures how quickly your app is responding.
3. Use **Azure Monitor** to configure alerts:
   - Navigate to **Alerts** in the left-hand menu.
   - Set up rules (e.g., trigger an alert if CPU usage exceeds 80%).
   - Provide an action group to notify via email, SMS, or other means.
4. Analyze the data to identify and resolve performance bottlenecks.

## üìà Step 7: Scale Your Web App

### Scale Up (Increase App Service Plan Resources)
1. Go to your web app in the Azure Portal.
2. In the left-hand menu, select **Scale Up (App Service Plan)**.
3. Choose a higher pricing tier to increase resources such as CPU, memory, and storage.
4. Click **Apply** to save the changes.

### Scale Out (Increase App Instances)
1. Navigate to **Scale Out (App Service Plan)** in the web app menu.
2. Choose your scaling method:
   - **Manual Scaling**:
     - Adjust the number of instances manually by increasing the count.
   - **Autoscaling**:
     - Click on **Add a Rule**.
     - Set conditions (e.g., scale out when CPU usage exceeds 70%).
     - Configure the minimum and maximum number of instances.
3. Save the changes and monitor the scaling behavior.

By following these steps, your web app can efficiently handle increased traffic and workloads! üöÄ
